## 1. Target Environment

- **Application**: OWASP Juice Shop (latest stable version)
- **Hosting**: Docker container running locally on a private lab machine
- **Access Point**: http://localhost:3000
- **Infrastructure**: Isolated lab environment with no internet exposure

## 2. Testing Type

- **Approach**: Black-box penetration test
- **Knowledge Level**: No access to source code, logs, or system internals
- **Restrictions**: No use of public write-ups, tutorials, or challenge solutions related to OWASP Juice Shop

## 3. Allowed Activities

- Manual and automated testing of web application input vectors
- Use of tools such as Burp Suite, browser developer tools, curl, Nmap, and others
- Interception and manipulation of HTTP requests
- Use of standard penetration testing techniques (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, brute force)
- Authentication and session handling tests using own test account(s)

## 4. Testing Constraints

- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Strictly prohibited
- **Privilege Escalation Outside App Scope**: Not allowed (e.g., escaping container)
- **Social Engineering**: Not applicable
- **Persistence or Malware Deployment**: Not applicable
- **External Target Interaction**: Only the Juice Shop container is in-scope
- **Time constraint**: 20 hours for the penetration testing
